**MazeWith** is a full-stack, real-time multiplayer maze game built with React & TypeScript. Players use their mobile devices as controllers to navigate the maze. The game screen displays the maze and player movements in real-time.

## üöÄ Project Overview

**MazeWith** is a multiplayer game where players control their character through a maze using their phones as controllers. The game is separated into three key components:

1. [**Website**](https://github.com/mazewith/website): Provides an introduction to the game, its features, and a guide on how to play.
2. [**Game Screen**](https://github.com/mazewith/game): Displays the maze, real-time player movement, and game status.
3. [**Controller**](https://github.com/mazewith/controller): Allows players to control their characters using their mobile devices.
